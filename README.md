# pointCloudAlgos
Uses exported 3D models from the iphone's Lidar sensor to test 3D point cloud algorithms.


## Objectives
1. Determine shortest route between two points.
2. Determine closest object.
3. Segment 3D point cloud into point clusters.

This project is WIP and has been written in Python
